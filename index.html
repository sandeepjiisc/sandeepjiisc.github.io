		 	<p>Abdul Rashid Salim Salman Khan (born 27 December 1965),[3] credited as Salman Khan (pronunciation: [səlˈmaːn ˈxaːn]), is an Indian film actor, producer,<br/> television personality, singer and philanthropist. In a film career spanning more than twenty five years, Khan has received numerous awards, including two National<br/> Film Awards as a producer, and two Filmfare Awards as an actor. Described by the CNN as one of the world's biggest stars,[4] he has a significant following in Asia<br/> and the Indian diaspora worldwide, and is cited in the media as one of the most popular and commercially successful actors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_India">Indian cinema</a>.</p>
		 	<p>The son of screenwriter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salim_Khan">Salim</a>, Khan began his acting career with a supporting role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biwi_Ho_To_Aisi">Biwi Ho To Aisi</a> (1988) and achieved breakthrough with a leading role in his<br/> next release—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sooraj_Barjatya">Sooraj Barjatya's</a> romance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Pyar_Kiya">Maine Pyar Kiya</a> (1989). Khan went on to establish himself in Bollywood in the 1990s with roles in several top-grossing<br/> productions, including the romantic drama <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum_Aapke_Hain_Koun..!">Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!</a> (1994), the action thriller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Arjun">Karan Arjun</a> (1995), the comedy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biwi_No.1">Biwi No.1</a> (1999), and the family<br/> drama <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum_Saath-Saath_Hain">Hum Saath-Saath Hain</a> (1999). For his role in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karan_Johar">Karan Johar's</a> romantic drama Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Khan was awarded the Filmfare Award for Best<br/> Supporting Actor. After a brief period of decline in the 2000s, Khan achieved greater stardom in the 2010s by playing the lead role in several successful action<br/> films, including Dabangg (2010), Bodyguard (2011), Ek Tha Tiger (2012), Kick (2014), Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) and Sultan (2016) all rank among the highest-<br/> Bollywood films of all time. Ten of the films in which Khan has acted in have accumulated gross earnings of over ₹1 billion (US$16 million).[7][8][9][10] He is<br/> the only actor to star in the highest-grossing Bollywood films of nine separate years.[11] Khan topped Forbes India charts for 2014, in terms of both fame and<br/> revenues.[12] According to the Forbes 2015 list of 'Celebrity 100 : The World's Top-Paid Entertainers 2015', Khan was the highest ranked Indian in 71st rank with<br/> earnings of $33.5 million.</p>
		 	<p>In addition to his acting career, Khan is a stage performer and an active humanitarian through his charity non-profit organisation, Being Human.[14] Khan's off-<br>screen life is marred by controversy and legal troubles. His tumultuous relationship with Aishwarya Rai, his hunting of endangered species, and a negligent driving<br> case in which he ran over five people with his car, killing one, have been extensively covered by the Indian media.[15] For the last of these, Khan was sentenced to<br/> five years' imprisonment in 2015, but was later acquitted.[16][17][18]</p>
